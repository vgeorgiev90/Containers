Your HA Hadoop cluster is confgigured and deployed, in order to promote the first of the namenodes to active state execute:
kubectl exec -it hadoop-namenode-0 -- hdfs haadmin -transitionToActive namenode1

Example failover test:
kubectl exec -it hadoop-namenode-0 -- hdfs haadmin -failover namenode1 namenode2

Expected result:
namenode2 should transition to active state and namenode1 should transition to standby state


#TODO
implement zookeeper for automatic HA transition
