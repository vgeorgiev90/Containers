#General guidance

1. Verify that all your security settings are properly enforced
2. Always use the latest stable k8s version
3. Audit the OS , container runtime and k8s configuration (with tools like: kube-auto-analyzer, kube-bench)
4. Log everything to a location outside the cluster

#Image security

1. Use private registries and restrict public usage
2. Scan all images for vulnerabilities (coreOS clair or Atomic Scan)
3. Decide which types/severity of issues should prevent deployments
4. Maintain standard base images and ensure all workloads use them
5. DO NOT run containers as the root user

#K8s components security

1. Api Server - authorization-mode=Node,RBAC
2. Ensure all services are protected by TLS
3. Ensure kubelet protects its API via authorization-mode=Webhook
4. Ensure kube-dashboard uses restrictive RBAC role and v1.7+
5. Monitor RBAC policy failures
6. Remove default service account permissions

#Network security
1. Filter access to any cloud provider metadata (APIs,URL , IAM permissions etc.)
2. Use CNI plugin that filters ingress/egress pod traffic
  a. Properly label all pods
  b. Isolate all wordloads from each other
  c. Prevent workloads from egressing to internet, Pod IP space, Node IP space, and/or other internal networks
  d. restrict traffic comming into kube-system namespace except kube-dns
3. Consider a service mesh

#Workload containment and security
1. Namespace per tenant
2. default network deny inbound on all namespaces
3. Assign CPU/RAM limits to all containers
4. Set automountServiceAccountToken: false  on pods who do not need tokens
5. Use PodSecurityPolicy to enforce container restrictions and protect the node
6. Implement container-aware malicious activity detection

#Misc security
1. Collect logs from all containers , especially the RBAC access/deny logs
2. Encrypt the content of etcd , and run etcd on dedicated nodes
3. Separate cloud accounts,VPC/resource groups for cloud providers
4. Separate clusters for dev/test and production environment
5. Separate node pools for different tenants
